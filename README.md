Data Mining on Mental Health Survey Data
Overview
This project is aimed at using data mining techniques to extract meaningful insights from a mental health survey dataset. 
The survey contained questions related to demographics, lifestyle, medical history, mental health disorders, and other related factors.

Approach
The project involved several steps, including data preprocessing, data exploration, and model building.
We first performed data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning, imputation, and feature scaling.
We then explored the dataset using various visualization techniques to gain insights into the data distribution, feature importance, and correlations.
We also performed feature selection and dimensionality reduction to eliminate irrelevant or redundant features.

Next, we built several machine learning models to predict mental health disorders based on the available features.
We used a range of algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
We evaluated the performance of each model using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
We also performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model parameters and improve the model performance.

Finally, we interpreted the results of the model to extract meaningful insights into the mental health factors that contribute to 
the prevalence of mental health disorders. Our findings revealed that factors such as age, gender, education level, income, smoking, and a
lcohol consumption were strongly associated with mental health disorders.
We also discovered that certain mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety were more prevalent in certain demographic groups, 
such as young adults and women.

Conclusion
This project demonstrated the potential of data mining techniques to extract valuable insights from mental health survey data. 
The insights gained from this project can be used to inform public health policies and interventions aimed at improving mental health outcomes. 
The code and results of this project can be found in this repository, and can be used as a starting point for further research on mental health and related topics.
